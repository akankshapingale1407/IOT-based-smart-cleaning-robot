<br>
This project is an IoT-enabled smart robotic floor cleaner designed to automate floor cleaning in homes and offices. It integrates ultrasonic sensors for obstacle avoidance, motor drivers for motion control, and an IoT module (NodeMCU ESP8266) for real-time monitoring and remote control via a cloud platform.
<br>
The robot is equipped with a vacuum mechanism or mop-based cleaning system and can be controlled or tracked remotely through the Blynk/ThingSpeak platform. It provides both manual and autonomous cleaning modes.
<br><br>
<h3>## Features</h3>
- Autonomous floor navigation using ultrasonic sensors
- Real-time monitoring and control via IoT (Wi-Fi)
- Obstacle detection and automatic rerouting
- Cleaning status tracking on mobile app/cloud
- Manual override/control via Blynk app (optional)
- Battery-level indicator (optional enhancement)

<br><br>
<h3>## How It Works</h3>
<br> The ultrasonic sensors continuously scan the surroundings.
<br> If an obstacle is detected, the robot changes direction.
<br> The NodeMCU sends data to a cloud platform (e.g., Blynk or ThingSpeak).
<br> Users can track cleaning progress or control the bot remotely.
<br> The cleaning mechanism (mop/vacuum) runs simultaneously during motion.
